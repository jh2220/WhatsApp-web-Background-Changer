# WhatsApp-web-Background-Changer
You can change background image in your Whats app web page (Only Chrome)


Because this is a programming study ... the installation of this API is manual, but installation is not complicated, here is a step by step how to install and use this API.

## Install

The first step to install this API manually you need to access the chrome API page `chrome://extensions/`

Then you need to activate the developer method, a popup will appear asking you to indicate the directory. **It is very important that you point to the main directory**, and not the subfolders of the API directory.

## Usage

a popup will appear in the chrome API bar, next to the link field, clicking on it will cause the following events to occur.

1. When he is out of the Whatsapp page he will appear asking to redirect the page.
2. A bar will ask for the image link, you need to insert the link of an image URL, if the bar turns blue, it means that the image was found, otherwise the bar will turn red.

## What is an Image URL and how do I insert mine?
An image URL is an image file that is on a server machine when you access a website and an image appears. You can collect its URL just by right-clicking and selecting the "Open image in a new tab" option.

As I didnâ€™t support an image upload, you have to do the upload yourself, for that you need a server machine or a website that keeps images access to everything, something like [IMGur](https://imgur.com/) or [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/)
